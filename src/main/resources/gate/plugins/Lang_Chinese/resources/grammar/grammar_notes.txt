The longest string gets the highest priority.
For example,
century +decade
century +decade+decade_suffix

both construct a ‘DATE’, but ‘century +decade+decade_suffix’ gets the higher priority.

Another example, if locations are not separated words or symbols, they (the whole string) must be marked as a location.
