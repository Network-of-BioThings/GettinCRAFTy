Hi Di
Sorry, I make mistakes again in organisation rules here. It is impossible
that a Token.String includes an org_key, as an org_key itself consists of at
least one token. I change it as following:

An Organization can be 'Location + organization name + org_key'
where, organiztion name can be void or includes 1, 2 or 3 tokens.
Examples:
1) 'Hong Kong government', here 'Hong Kong' is 'Location', 'government' is a
org_key, and organization name is void.
2) 'Hong Kong Phoenix international school', here 'Phoenix' is organization
name, and 'international school' is a org_key.

Hi Di
Items in the following lists can be shorter than the Token:
currency_unit.lst
digit.lst
loc_key.lst
more.lst
number_unit
percent_end.lst
percent_pre.lst
person_ending.lst
point.lst
surname.lst
year_key.lst
zero.lst

For the two rules for Foreign Name,
s_name (title appears before or after)
s_name (person_ending appears after)
the title/person_ending is just context.
