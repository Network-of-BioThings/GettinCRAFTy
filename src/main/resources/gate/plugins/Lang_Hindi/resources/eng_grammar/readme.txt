README file for Muse grammars directory.


The main directory contains the default grammars (used in main.jape).
It also contains grammars for scientific and religious texts (those with sci and relig suffixes).

The enamex grammars now use POS tags, which means the splitter and tagger must be run first.
For a version that does not require the tagger, look in the muse subdirectory.
