USING SUPPLE
============

See the GATE user guide for details of how to build and use SUPPLE:

UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION
=================================

Prior to GATE 3.1, the SUPPLEFile parameter to the SUPPLE processing resource
was of type java.io.File.  From 3.1 it is of type java.net.URL.  This means
that if you have any existing saved applications (.gapp files) that contain
SUPPLE they will have to be updated for the new version.  To update your .gapp
file, open it in a text editor (it's just an XML document) and search for the
string "SUPPLEFile".  On Unix/Linux/Mac you should find something like:

<entry>
  <string>SUPPLEFile</string>
  <file>/path/to/GATE/plugins/SUPPLE/supple.swi</file>
</entry>

change <file>...</file> to <string>...</string> and save the .gapp file.
It should now load into GATE as before.

On Windows, it is slightly more involved: starting from

<entry>
  <string>SUPPLEFile</string>
  <file>X:\GATE\plugins\SUPPLE\supple.swi</file>
</entry>

you need to change <file> into <string> as above, but also prepend "file:/" to
the path:

<entry>
  <string>SUPPLEFile</string>
  <string>file:/X:\GATE\plugins\SUPPLE\supple.swi</string>
</entry>
