Modern markets :  confident consumers.
A fair deal and prosperity go hand in hand. 
Local education authorities LEAs are responsible, by law, for making sure that registered pupils of compulsory school age attend their school regularly. 
Education welfare officers work closely with schools.
And better performance in business in turn benefits consumers. 
In its White Paper,  modern markets :  confident consumers,  the Government has set a new agenda. 
to avoid burdening businesses with unnecessary regulation.
The White Paper will benefit all consumers but the Government will focus in particular on the needs of those with less developed consumer skills,  those who are socially excluded and those on low incomes.
Open and competitive markets are the best guarantee of a good deal for consumers. 
The Government is putting in place a framework that fosters free and fair competition,  but is tough on those who seek to damage the competitive process. 
The Government is launching an annual study to investigate whether prices are higher in the UK than in the US,  France and Germany. 
Knowledgeable and demanding consumers.
The Government will take steps to ensure that consumers have access to accurate,  comprehensive and comprehensible information.
