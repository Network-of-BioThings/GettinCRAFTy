Model Licenses

Alias-I say:

Note that the models themselves are often subject to additional licensing
restrictions inherited from the corpora from which they were trained. These
restricted models are themselves often available for commercial purposes by
contract to the original creator of the data, or through Alias-i. All models,
to the best of our knowledge, allow research use. 

For more information on the models and their licensing issues please refer
