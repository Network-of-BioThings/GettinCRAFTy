Upgrading to SUPPLE from BuChart
================================

In theory upgrading your application to use SUPPLE instead of the now
deprecated BuChart parser should be relatively straightforward. Basically any
instance of BuChart needs to be replaced by SUPPLE. Changes you need to make or
be aware of are:

    * The compiled parser files are now supple.swi, supple.sicstus, or
      supple.plcafe
    * The GATE wrapper parameter buchartFile is now SUPPLEFile
    * The Prolog wrappers now start shef.nlp.supple.prolog instead of
      shef.nlp.buchart.prolog
    * If you are using SICStus or SWI prolog, and your prolog binary is not on
      your path or is installed under a non-standard name, you will need to
      specify its location via a system property supple.sicstus.executable (or
      supple.swi.executable as appropriate).
    * The mapping.conf file now has lines starting SUPPLE; instead of Buchart;
    * Most importantly the main wrapper class is now called
      shef.nlp.supple.SUPPLE

Making these changes to existing code should be trivial and allow you to
benefit from future improvements to SUPPLE.
