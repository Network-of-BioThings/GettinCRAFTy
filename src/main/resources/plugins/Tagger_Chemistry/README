DESCRIPTION
=======================================================================

This GATE module is designed to tag a number of chemistry items in
running text. Currently the tagger tags compound formulas (e.g.
SO2, H2O, H2SO4 ...) ions (e.g. Fe3+, Cl-) and element names
and symbols (e.g. Sodium and Na). Limited support for compound names
is also provided (e.g. sulphur dioxide) but only when followed by
a compound formula (in parenthesis or commas).

=======================================================================
OBTAINING THE SOFTWARE
=======================================================================

The chemistry tagger is distributed as part of GATE, and is available
in the Chemistry_Tagger plugin directory.

=======================================================================
USING THE TAGGER WITHIN GATE
=======================================================================

Using the tagger should be really simple.  When you run the GATE GUI
register this directory (use the '-d URL' command line switch or the
plugin management console) and then simply add the "Chemistry Tagger"
to your pipeline, accepting the default parameter settings.

To use the tagger once created it has to be part of a pipeline in which
the document has already been tokenised and sentence split.
The annotations added to documents are "ChemicalCompound", "ChemicalIon"
and "ChemicalElement" (currently they are always placed in the default
annotation set).
