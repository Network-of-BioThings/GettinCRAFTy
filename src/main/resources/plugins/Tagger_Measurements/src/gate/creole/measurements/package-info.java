/**
 * This package contains a GATE PR which attempt to annotate and normalize
 * measurements appearing within documents. Each measurement is also normalized
 * back to SI units which allows measurements specified using different units to
 * be compared. For example 30cm and 300mm are both normalized to 0.3m. The
 * parsing of measurements is based upon a modified version of the <a
 * href="http://units-in-java.sourceforge.net/">Java port</a> of the <a
 * href="http://www.gnu.org/software/units/">GNU Units</a> package.
